#1. Create a while loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 0
#and then prints "Hello World!" at the end.
i=5
#ehile i >= 1:
# print(i)
# time.sleep(1)
#else:
# print ( "hello world")
#2. Create a while loop that prints only even numbers
#between 1 and 30.
j =2
#AHAIL J <= 2==0:
# print(j)
# j += 2
#3. Create a while loop that repeats until the user
#inputs the number 0.
k = int(input())
while k != 1:
    print(k)
    k = int(input())
